                <a class="desc">then i moved it into unity, adding materials and extra details to the model. i also created sound systems for velocity-based wind distortion and grass footsteps to bring more presence to the experience.</a>
                <a class="desc">a big part of the world is the grass shader, which i put together with claude, as i don't know hlsl. i knew i wanted quad-based grass using a given texture, so i started with that and prompted until it had the feature set it does now (perlin noise wind movement, distance-shrinking, color and size variation, etc.).</a>
                <a class="desc">to bring the entire experience together, i put together two ambient soundtracks for the top and bottom halves of the world.</a>

                <a class="desc">these trackers started as something i personally wanted to use and are still designed with that in mind: the best possible wifi-based SlimeVR trackers for myself and others. a solid imu with ~18h battery life in a small, lightweight form factor (44x44x18mm, ~50g).</a>

                <a class="desc">using a blockbench plugin called "animated java", he could get some barebones animation support (not very user friendly), but more importantly, a json holding keyframe data.</a>
                <a class="desc">i analyzed the keyframe output of mineimator and compared it to animated java's json output, brainstorming how i might convert one format to the other.</a>
                <a class="desc">using zig's standard library json capabilities, i was able to come up with a fairly efficient O(n) (per file) method for converting the data.</a>
